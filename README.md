# DyescapeBot
The DyescapeBot is a chat bot for services like Discord, which is integrated into Dyescape; the largest upcoming
Minecraft MMORPG server. This bot will contain several integrations to our game. The bot is open source and public to
all. If you wish to contribute, please see our contribution guidelines.


## Introduction
The vision of this project is to allow users on different chat platforms, such as Discord, to be able to interact with
our game through these chat services. For example, game related alerts (events for example), item inspection, monster
inspection, update notifications, etc. You'll be able to invite this bot into your own servers and configure the
behaviour of the bot that suits your desires.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, so long they respect the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). Please be sure to read
these guidelines before contributing. Contributors are rewarded with a small medal on our services.
